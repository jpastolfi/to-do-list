# To do list


Hi, there! This is a basic to do list I've developed using React during my studies. I haven't used any CSS frameworks in this project, so all you can see was done using handmande CSS code. All of the components created are class components since I hadn't learned about function components at the time. 


## Functionalities

As a common to do list, you can:
- Add tasks to a tasklist
- Remove tasks in whichever order you want
- Click the 'undo' button to undo the last change. This includes adding and also removing a task.
